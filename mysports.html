My favourite sport is Football. I have been learning Football for 4 years. My favourite Football player is Cristiano Ronaldo. My main 
sport in school is also Football. I have been going to tournaments like SFL and SFA. They were one of my best experiences. I can 
play any position in Football But Midfield is my favourite position. Our school team has come 3 position in some of the tournaments.
